# Service Level Agreement (SLA) Definitions

## Overview

This document defines the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for all microservices in the SOA architecture, ensuring consistent performance, reliability, and accountability across the system.

## SLA Targets

### 1. Availability SLA
- **Target**: 99.5% uptime
- **Measurement Period**: Monthly
- **Calculation**: (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time × 100
- **Downtime Definition**: Service unavailable for more than 30 seconds

### 2. Response Time SLA
- **Target**: 95% of requests under 200ms
- **Measurement Period**: Daily
- **Calculation**: 95th percentile response time
- **Exclusions**: Network latency, client processing time

### 3. Error Rate SLA
- **Target**: Less than 0.1% error rate
- **Measurement Period**: Daily
- **Calculation**: (Error Responses / Total Responses) × 100
- **Error Definition**: HTTP 5xx status codes

### 4. Throughput SLA
- **Target**: Support 1000 requests per minute
- **Measurement Period**: Peak hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
- **Calculation**: Requests per minute during peak hours

- **Throughput Monitoring**: Requests per minute tracking

### 2. Alerting Thresholds
- **Warning Level**: 80% of SLA target
- **Critical Level**: 90% of SLA target
- **Emergency Level**: 95% of SLA target

### 3. Escalation Procedures
1. **Level 1**: Automated alerts to on-call engineer
2. **Level 2**: Escalation to team lead after 15 minutes
3. **Level 3**: Escalation to management after 30 minutes
4. **Level 4**: Escalation to CTO after 1 hour
